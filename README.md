# Tetris
WIP

Tetris game using Javascript, HTML and CSS built using tutorial from freeCodeCamp/Ania Kubow.

To-do/Fixes;
- Create grid using javaScript, instead of HTML file.
- ~~Fix rotation of piece when near the edge, as it appears on other side of the grid~~.
- Add testing.
- Bottom of game grid not disappering, linked to game freezing once clearing a line.
- Add additional stlying (low priority.)
