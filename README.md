# Tetris

Tetris game using Javascript, HTML and CSS built using tutorial from freeCodeCamp/Ania Kubow. Additional code has been added to change/update/modify the game outside of basic starter code, taught during tutorial.

Bug/Fixes;
- ~~Fix rotation of piece when near the edge, as it appears on other side of the grid~~. Additional code added to solve problem.
- ~~Bottom of game grid not disappering, linked to game freezing once clearing a line~~. Needed to change varaible squares to let from const, as value needs to change whilst playing.

Possible Future Changes;
- Create grid using javaScript, instead of HTML file.
- Add testing.
- Add additional stlying (low priority).
